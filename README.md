# 100 Apps

Learning iOS development by creating 100 apps in 100 days.

To become sufficiently good at anything you need **practice, lots of it**. This is me learning iOS development from no prior experience.

## Apps

- Day 1: Hello World
- Day 2: Like

## Rules

Here are a couple rules I've put for myself

- Apps must be created in 1 day on the day. No working ahead.
- Each app must have a unique feature.
- Do not copy any source code at all.
